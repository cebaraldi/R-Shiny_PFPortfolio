At that time Rheinische Heim GmbH (Bonn) and Rote Erde GmbH (Münster), Westfälische Lippe Heimstätte GmbH (Dortmund) and Rheinische Heimstätte GmbH (Düsseldorf) merged into one company. Initially, the focus was on city refurbishment and city development projects, in the construction of residential buildings and in small-scale housing development projects. In 1980, the development and marketing of fallow lands was added.In the following years, LEG continually expanded its real estate holdings through residential construction projects, holdings and corporate acquisitions. In 1987, the company acquired the portfolio of Neuen Heimat NRW GmbH with about 38,000 residential units. Two years later, it acquired the federal states residential company Rheinland Cologne with about 8,000 residential units. With the increasing competition in the real estate markets in the 1990s, LEG cemented its focus as a company consistently oriented on the private sector.Today, the LEG Group manages about 95,000 residential units with over 260,000 tenants and is thus one of the leading housing companies in Germany. The company is a market-and customer-oriented service provider, satisfying the high demand for affordable living space.

In the first nine months of 2013, we realised adjusted Service Revenues of EUR 212.9 million (9M 2012: EUR217.2 million). Service Revenues is a key figure that substantially reflects the earnings from providing ongoing wireless services (voice and data transmission) and billing of the same based on existing customer relations.The dynamic development of the Company and the excellent business results of the first nine months of 2013 are the consequence of the strategic reorientation. During 9M 2013, the MVNO subscriber base continued to rise and reached the figure of 1.648 million subscribers (9M 2012: 1.389 million) per 30 September 2013.
